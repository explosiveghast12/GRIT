# GRIT
A multi-platform app for ios/android to track workouts, this repository was created to set up a base for the app.
The backend here uses python while the frontend uses react (JavaScript?)

NOTE: This may not be an ideal way to structure our app, but it will work.

MAKE SURE TO SET YOUR PATH VARIABLES
Development envoirnment setup (for windows) (use whatever editor you want):
1. Install python 
2. Create virtual enviornment (python -m venv {path to enviornment}) (Good idea, but technically optional)
3. Install django (python -m pip install django)
4. Install node.js and nvm-windows

TODO:
[]-Make this README match requirements
[]-Configure API for Python Backend
[]-Assign front-end and back-end developers (or have everyone do full stack, IDK)
[]-Create a .gitignore file
